If you have the most victory points, congratulations, you win! 

In order to calculate victory points, here are the steps:

Victory points coming from unlocked wonder stages and blue cards will be calculated directly.

Your battle points (not shields!) are each count as one victory point.

Yellow and purple cards are checked as they might have abilities that will grant you points.

Greeb cards earn victory points in two very different ways: from sets of identical symbols and from sets of 3 different symbols.

Be careful : the victory points earned by both methods are cumulative.

If you have n(max 4) number of same symbols, you win n^2 victory points.

If you have three different symbols(a set), you win 7 victory points.
