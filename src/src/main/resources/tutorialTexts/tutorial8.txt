This is the other players view.

You can keep track of other players that are not neighbors.

Initially, a condensed view is available.

This view will show their names, their gold, their shields and the battle loss points.

Right under these, it shows their wonder stages and whether or not they've upgraded them.

If you click on these labels, their construction zone will open up.

You cannot interact with their cards, it is only for follow up.

If you click on the label again, the zone will close.
